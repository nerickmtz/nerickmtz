Hi, I’m Nerick! I’m a passionate learner currently making a career shift into cybersecurity. My focus is on protecting digital assets and ensuring information systems stay secure. Along the way, I've been gaining hands-on experience in areas like threat analysis, incident response, and security automation.

This portfolio is a collection of my projects and research, showing the skills I’m building as I dive deeper into the cybersecurity world. I’m always learning and adapting to the constantly changing landscape, and I’m excited to share my journey with you as I move forward in this new direction.
## Objective
Aspiring to transition into cybersecurity, I am leveraging my Machine Operator experience to become a proficient Security Analyst. My goal is to apply my analytical skills and passion for technology to protect and secure digital environments.

I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
